# BabyDontYouCry

An open-source XR game of hunting animals in the dark built using Unity.
## Game Description
You need to use your hearing to aim in the direction and "fling" the phone to shoot an arrow at the animal.

## Project Highlights
* Gyro-controller to get the player orientation and control the player in the game world.
* A minimal procedurally generated landscape.
* A glow shader that makes the animal eyes glow.
